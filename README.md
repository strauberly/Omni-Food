# OmniFood

## Thank you for checking out this project. It was put together by Jonas Schmedtmann (https://codingheroes.io/) as part of his course on html 5 and css 3 and is the final project for the course. content.md, images provided by Jonas.

## The idea was to put together a site for a fictional company using what we learned in the 37.5 lecture hour course. I am looking forward to using what I learned here in order to build my own full stack project for my portfolio.

## This README will serve as a dev journal for the time being. Cheers!
