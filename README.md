# OmniFood

## Thank you for checking out this project. It was put together by Jonas Schmedtmann (https://codingheroes.io/) as part of his course on html 5 and css 3 and is the final project for the course.

## The idea was to put together a site for a fictional company using what we learned in the 37.5 lecture hour course. I am looking forward to using what I learned here in order to build my own full stack project for my portfolio.

## This README will serve as a dev journal for the time being. Cheers!

Began the project by mapping out starter files and looking over the notes and materials provided by the client. Really excited for this project, here we go!
